	* sampsize 0.6.0: Continuity correction option for comparing
	two percentages (sample size and power). Default is no correction.
	Implemented sample size and power for non-inferiority (equivalence) 
	tests of two percentages and two means.

2003-06-05  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.5.1: Minor bug fix release. Now compiles on Sparc-R220
	Sun Solaris (8) and PPC-G4 Mac-OS X (10.2).  

2003-06-05  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.5.0: Added power and minimum detectable odds-ratio for 
	unmatched case-control studies, sample size and power for 1:1 matched
	case-control studies. Added sample size in comparative studies of
	means and percentages, adjusted for cluster size and intraclass
	correlation.
	Corrected a bug in the self-test script chk.
	Improved web-interface.
	Added a postscript manual.
	
2003-05-30  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.4.0: First beta release. The code of some previously slow
	functions has been optimized.  A certification script is now used for
	result validation and error checking of every new release. The results
	of the certification log have been checked for accuracy either against
	results obtained from manual computations, against statistical tables
	from [Schlesselman JJ. Case-Control Studies. Oxford Univ. Press 1982],
	or against results obtained from a commercial statistical software
	compiled for the i386 architecture, under linux.  Internal
	computations of sampsize are in double precision.  
	Two files were added in a cgi-bin subdirectory, which can be used to
	access sampsize from a cgi web-interface. 
	
2003-05-24  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.3.1: Corrected a bug in one numerical function. The bug
	resulted in sample sizes and power too conservative when entered means
	were not integers. It did not affect other computations than sample
	size and power determination for studies comparing means.
	
2003-05-24  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.3.0: Added power determination. Most planned
	features are now implemented, and no new feature will be 
	added until the first beta release.
	
2003-05-24  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.2.3: Added options for comparative studies of 
	percentages and means.
	
2003-05-17  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.2.2: Improved numerical library, cleaner output,
	added Binomial Exact Confidence Intervals. 
	
2003-05-13  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.2.1: Cleaned up code. Minor bug fixes, cleaner output.
	
2003-05-13  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.2.0: Corrected display bug with very large sample sizes.
	Added -level option, to compute any size give a CI% confidence
	interval with any CI >= 50%. Separated the code file for numerical 
	functions: the provided numfunc.c, numfunc.h are now required to 
	compile. 
	Added case control options.
	
2003-05-08  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.1.5: Corrected bug where an sampsize entered
	into an infinite loop if -nob non null and -pr null (a nonsense
	combination of parameters). Added more documentation to the code. 

2003-05-08  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.1.4: added binomial method for small samples, 
	exact method for prevalence equals zero.
	* cmdline.c: added -nob option.

2003-05-06  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.1.3: corrected other bugs

2003-05-02  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.1.2: corrected bugs

2003-05-02  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.1.1: changed parsing of command line options

2003-04-19  Philippe Glaziou  <glaziou@pasteur-kh.org>
	* sampsize 0.1.0: initial version
