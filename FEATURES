Sampsize features:
	* Command line interface

Sampsize computes:
	* Sample size for prevalence surveys
	* Finite population correction
	* Sample size to detect a minimum number of events
	* Exact binomial confidence intervals
	* Sample size for one-sample comparison of percentage to
	  hypothesized value
	* Sample size for two-sample comparison of percentages, with
	  or without continuity correction
	* Sample size for one-sample comparison of mean to hypothesized value 
	* Sample size for two-sample comparison of means 
	* Sample size in comparative studies of means and percentages,
	  adjusted for cluster size and intraclass correlation
	* Power of comparative studies of percentages (one and two-samples), 
	  with or without continuity correction
	* Power of comparative studies of means (one and two-samples)
	* Sample size for unmatched case-control studies
	* Power and minimum/maximum detectable odds-ratio (unmatched 
          case-control studies)
	* Sample size and power of 1:1 matched case-control studies
	* Sample size of non-inferiority trials with comparison of means 
	  and percentages
