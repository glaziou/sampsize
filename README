  ¹note: optional programme checking for accuracy against results from a master
  certification log created on 32-bit i386. The certification script will fail
  on 62-bit processors, and should display minor differences in some results, 
  but this is of no practical consequence.



IMPORTANT NOTE:
  This version of sampsize implements power and sample size for comparison of
  percentages using formulae without continuity correction. Results will thus
  slightly differ from previous versions of sampsize. The continuity correction
  is still available with the additional option -cc.  That change is detailed
  in the manpage and in the manual.



USAGE -- Examples

***** Prevalence surveys *****

  *
      To calculate the sample size given a 50% prevalence (default) and
      infinite population size (also default), with 5% precision: the upper
      boundary of the confidence interval will equal the observed prevalence
      plus 5%, and the lower boundary will equal the observed prevalence minus
      5%, i.e. [45% - 55%]:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -e 5

      Assumptions:

           Precision          = 5.00  %
           Prevalence         = 50.00 %
           Population size    = infinite

              95% Confidence Interval specified limits [  45%   --   55% ]
              (these limits equal prevalence plus or minus precision)

      Estimated sample size:
                            n =      385

              95% Binomial Exact Confidence Interval with n =      385
              and n * prevalence =    193 observed events:
              [45.0212%   -- 55.2365% ]


  *
      To get the needed sample size after correction for population size (n =
      1500):

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -e 5 -pop 1500

      Assumptions:

           Precision          = 5.00  %
           Prevalence         = 50.00 %
           Population size    = 1500

              95% Confidence Interval specified limits [  45%   --   55% ]
              (these limits equal prevalence plus or minus precision)

      Estimated sample size:
                            n =      306

  *
      Assuming a prevalence of 10%, a precision of 4% estimated using a 90%
      confidence interval, and a target population size of 2500:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -pr 10 -e 4 -pop 2500 -level 90

      Assumptions:

           Precision          = 4.00  %
           Prevalence         = 10.00 %
           Population size    = 2500

              90% Confidence Interval specified limits [   6%   --   14% ]
              (these limits equal prevalence plus or minus precision)

      Estimated sample size:
                            n =      144

  *
      Assuming that the observed prevalence in the sample will be null, for a
      97.5% one-sided confidence interval upper limit that is equal to the
      entered precision (2% in this example), type:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -pr 0 -e 2

      Assumptions:

           Precision          = 2.00  %
           Prevalence         = 0.00 %
           Population size    = infinite

      A null prevalence was entered, we assume here that the observed
      prevalence in the sample will be null, and compute the sample
      size for an upper limit of the confidence interval equal to the
      entered precision. The population size is not taken into account
      even if a finite size was entered. Sample sizes are calculated
      using the binomial exact method.

      Assuming that the observed prevalence in the sample will be null, for 95%
      one-sided confidence interval upper limit equal to the entered precision
      (2% in this example), type:

           Population size    = infinite

      A null prevalence was entered, we assume here that the observed
      prevalence in the sample will be null, and compute the sample
      size for an upper limit of the confidence interval equal to the
      entered precision. The population size is not taken into account
      even if a finite size was entered. Sample sizes are calculated
      using the binomial exact method.

      A study on the hepatitis C virus aims at describing some characteristics
      of the virus strains. It is assumed that the prevalence of virus positive
      individuals is 10% in the population. The investigators wish to calculate
      the sample size needed to be 95% sure that at least 5 patients will
      harbour a virus.

***** Comparative studies of proportions *****

  *
      Someone claims that US females are more likely than US males to study
      French. Our null hypothesis is that the proportion of female French
      students is 0.5. We wish to compute the sample size that will give us a
      80% power to reject the null hypothesis if the true proportion of female
      French students is 75%.

      Assumptions:
               alpha =          5% (two-sided)
               power =         80%

      We want to conduct a survey on people's opinions of the President's
      performance. Specifically, we want to determine whether members of the
      President's party have a different opinion from people with another party
      affiliation. We estimate that only 25% of members of the President's
      party will say that the President is doing a poor job, whereas 40% of
      other parties will rate the President's performance as poor. We compute
      the sample size for alpha = 5% (two-sided) and power = 90%:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -cp 25 40

      Estimated sample size for two-sample comparison of percentages

      Test H:    p1 = p2, where p1 is the percentage in population 1
      and p2 is the percentage in population 2

      Assumptions:
              alpha =          5% (two-sided)
              power =         90%
                 p1 =         25%

                 n2 =        216

  *
      Following the calculation for the survey on the President's performance,
      we realize that we can sample only n1 = 300 members of the President's
      party and a sample of n2 = 150 members of other parties, due to time
      constraints. We wish to compute the power of our survey:

                  p1 =         25%
                  p2 =         40%

      sample size n2 =        150
               n2/n1 =        0.5

      We wish to study the proportion of patients who have not recovered from a
      back pain by 4 weeks, and compare the outcome between patients in whom
      sciatica was diagnosed and patients without sciatica. We know that
      typically, about 20% of acute low back pain patients have not recovered
      by 4 weeks and think that the percentage may be 30% for patients who also
      have sciatica. The sample size we would need to detect this difference
      between the two groups, with a two-sided alpha of 5% and a power or 80%
      is 313:

      Estimated sample size for two-sample comparison of percentages

      Now we look at the same example using 10 observations per cluster and an
      intraclass correlation of 0.1:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -cp 20 30 -power 80 -obsclus 10 -rho 0.1

      Estimated sample size for two-sample comparison of percentages

      Test H:    p1 = p2, where p1 is the percentage in population 1
      and p2 is the percentage in population 2

      Assumptions:
              alpha =          5% (two-sided)
              power =         80%
                 p1 =         20%
                 p2 =         30%

      Estimated sample size:
                 n1 =        313
                 n2 =        313


      Sample size adjusted for cluster design:

        Intraclass correlation     =        0.1
        Average obs. per cluster   =         10
        Minimum number of clusters =        119

      Estimated sample size per group:

                 n1 (corrected)    =        595
                 n2 (corrected)    =        595

  *
      Taking into account the cluster design of the study, our samples have
      increased to 595 per group and a total of 119 physicians (clusters).
      Finally, we try the calculation assuming only 40 physicians:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -cp 20 30 -power 80 -numclus 40 -rho 0.1

      Sample size adjusted for cluster design:

      Error: for rho =        0.1, the minimum number of clusters possible is:
             numclus =         63

  *
      We got an error message telling us that, given these sets of sample size
      parameters, it is not possible to estimate a sample size with fewer than
      63 clusters. We need to rerun sampsize with different parameters in order
      to get a manageable number of patients.

        Minimum number of clusters =         40

      Estimated sample size per group:

***** Comparative studies of means *****

  *
      We wish to test the effects of a low-fat diet on serum cholesterol
      levels. We will measure the difference in cholesterol level for each
      subject before and after being on the diet. Since there is only one group
      of subjects, all on diet, this is a one-sample test. Our null hypothesis
      is that the mean of individual differences in cholesterol level will be
      zero; i.e., mdiff = 0mg/100ml. If the effect of the diet is as large as a
      mean difference of -10mg/100ml, then we wish to have power of 95% for
      rejecting the null hypothesis. Since we expect a reduction in levels, we
      want to use a one-sided test with alpha = 2.5%. Based on past studies, we
      estimate that the standard deviation of the difference in cholesterol
      levels will be about 20mg/100ml:

      We are doing a study of the relationship of oral contraceptives (OC) and
      blood pressure (BP) level for women ages 35-39. From a pilot study, it
      was determined that the mean and standard deviation BP of OC users were
      132.86 and 15.34, respectively. The mean and standard deviation BP of OC
      users were 127.44 and 18.23. Since it is easier to find OC nonusers than
      users in the country were the study is conducted, we decide that n2, the
      size of the sample of OC users, should be twice n1, the size of the
      sample of OC users; that is, c = n2/n1 = 2. To compute the sample sizes
      for alpha = 5% (two-sided) and the power of 80%:

      Patients for the study on oral contraceptives and blood pressure will be
      recruited in 12 clinics, and we suspect some intraclass correlation
      (patients recruited in the same clinic are more alike than patients
      recruited from different clinics). Due to the cluster sampling design,
      patients are not independant observations, and we wish to correct the
      above sample size (sampsize returned a sample size of 108 in the first
      group, and 216 in the second group). We think that the intraclass
      correlation is fairly small (0.02), and compute:

      232 and n2 = 464, more than twice the initial sample size.
 

***** Case-Control Studies *****

  *
      We wish to conduct a case control study to assess whether bladder cancer
      is associated with past exposure to cigarette smoking. Cases will be
      patients with bladder cancer and controls will be patients hospitalized
      for injury. It is assumed that 20% of controls will be smokers or past
      smokers, and we wish to detect an odds-ratio of 2 with power 90%. Three
      controls will be recruited for one case:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -or 2 -exp 20 -c 3

      Assumptions:

           Odds ratio             =          2
           Exposed controls       =         20%
           Alpha risk             =          5%
           Power                  =         90%
           Controls / Case ratio  =          3

           Total exposed          =    23.3333%

      Estimated sample size:

           Number of cases        =        150
           Number of controls     =        450

           Total                  =        600

  *
      The above study on bladder cancer needed a total sample size of 600. An
      alternative is to conduct a matched case-control study of bladder cancer
      and cigarette smoking rather than the above unmatched study design. One
      case will be matched to one control. Again, the percentage of exposed
      controls is 20%, and we wish to detect a two-fold increased risk (OR =
      2). With these specifications, we need 226 pairs (total sample size 452).

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -or 2 -exp 20 -matched

      Assumptions:

           Odds ratio             =          2
           Exposed controls       =         20%
           Alpha risk             =          5%
           Power                  =         90%
           Probability of an
        exposure-discordant pair  =         40%

      Estimated sample size (number of pairs):

           Number of exposure discordant-pairs  =         91
           Number of pairs                      =        226
           Total sample size                    =        452

      The following table (Kline et al., 1978) shows previous induced abortions
      among multigravid cases and controls. (Primiigravidae were excluded since
      these women did not have prior pregnancies.):
       ___________________________
      |______|Spontaneous|Controls|
      |______|_abortions_|________|
      |PIA:__|___________|________|
      |___yes|______171__|____90__|
      |____no|______303__|___165__|
      |Total:|______474__|___255__|
      The power of the study for detecting a relative risk of R = 1.5 is
      calculated as follows:  [$c = 255/474 = 0.538$], percentage exposed in
      controls =  [$100\times90/255 = 35.29$]:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -or 1.5 -exp 35.29 -c 0.538 -n 474

      Assumptions:

           Odds ratio             =        1.5
           Exposed controls       =      35.29%
           Alpha risk             =          5%
           Controls / Case ratio  =      0.538

           Total exposed          =    41.6005%

           Number of cases        =        474
           Number of controls     =        255

           Total                  =        729

      Estimated power:

                            power =    72.0774%

      Kessler and Clark (1978) studied 365 males with bladder cancer and an
      equal number of controls, 35 percent of whom reported past use of
      nonnutritive sweeteners. Using a one-sided test at the alpha = 5% level,
      the smallest relative risk greater than one that can be detected with 90%
      power is RR = 1.55:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -n 365 -exp 35 -onesided

      Assumptions:

           Exposed controls       =         35%
           One-sided alpha risk   =          5%
           Power                  =         90
           Number of cases        =        365
           Number of controls     =        365

           Total                  =        730

      Estimated smallest and highest detectable odds-ratio:

         Highest  odds-ratio < 1  =   0.623181
         Smallest odds-ratio > 1  =    1.55439

***** Equivalence trials *****

      Researchers want to show that a new treatment is "as good as" the
      standard one. The success rates of both treatments are expected to be
      approximately 90%. The researchers want to be sure that the new treatment
      is no worse than the standard treatment by an amount of 10%. Then, the
      sample size for each treatment group is 155 patients:

            cunegonde:~>sampsize -cp 90 90 -d 10

Estimated sample size for two-sample non-inferiority comparison of percentages

Test H0:    p2 < p1 - delta, where p1 is the percentage in population 1,
p2 is the percentage in population 2, and delta is the critical value

Assumptions:
        alpha =          5% (two-sided)
        power =         90%
           p1 =         90%
           p2 =         90%
        delta =         10%

Estimated sample size per group:
           n =        155
